# lilac
A bloatless, easy-to-use and simple module manager including a configuration utility featuring a slick and minimal click gui. For Forge 1.8.9. Heavily in development.

## Including the library
```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url "https://repo.dreamys.studio/" }
}
```

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "studio.dreamys:lilac:1.0.0"
}
```
> Depending on your gradle version, you might have to use compile, or shade with shadow if the library is missing from the built .jar.

## Usage
Refer to the [example](https://github.com/DxxxxY/lilac/tree/master/src/main/java/studio/dreamys/test) for now.
